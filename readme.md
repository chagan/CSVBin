CSVBin
======

CSVBin is a simple python script that allows you to take a csv with points in lat-long format and convert it to a hexbinned shapefile.

The script requires [Binify](https://github.com/kevinschaul/binify) and the GDAL python library.

The example folder contains a csv of points and the two resulting shapefiles that are created.
